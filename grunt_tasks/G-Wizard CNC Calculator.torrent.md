G-Wizard CNC Calculator is a software program that helps CNC machinists optimize their cutting parameters for various CNC operations. It is developed by CNCCookbook, a company that provides online resources and software for CNC enthusiasts. G-Wizard CNC Calculator can calculate the best spindle speed and feed rate for milling, drilling, turning, reaming, sawing, tapping, thread milling, and more. It can also suggest the optimal cut depth and cut width, adjust to different machining scenarios, and provide CADCAM wizards that automate the process of finding the best feeds and speeds.

G-Wizard CNC Calculator is based on a powerful cutting physics engine that considers almost 60 different variables, such as tool geometry, material properties, machine rigidity, coolant type, chip thinning, and tool deflection. It also uses AI machine learning algorithms to learn from over 100,000 CNC users and improve its recommendations. G-Wizard CNC Calculator can handle more types of tooling than any other feeds and speeds calculator, including coated tools, ballnose end mills, upcut and downcut tools, compression tools, woodruff cutters, corner rounders, boring heads, and more.
 
G-Wizard CNC Calculator is especially useful for high speed machining (HSM), a technique that involves using higher spindle speeds and smaller chip loads to achieve faster material removal rates and better surface finish. G-Wizard CNC Calculator can help CNC machinists find the best HSM parameters for their machines and tools, as well as advise them on how to slow down in corners for non-HSM toolpaths. G-Wizard CNC Calculator can also help CNC machinists extend their tool life, reduce cycle time, and avoid breaking tools.
 
G-Wizard CNC Calculator is available as a free trial for 30 days, after which users can choose from different subscription plans depending on their needs. Users can also access free training materials and tutorials on how to use the software effectively. G-Wizard CNC Calculator is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Chromebooks. It can also be accessed online via a web browser.
 
G-Wizard CNC Calculator is a must-have software for any CNC machinist who wants to improve their productivity and quality of work. It is trusted by engineers at NASA, Tesla, and over 20,000 CNC users worldwide.
