## How to Use Steampunk Town Tiles
 
Steampunk Town Tiles includes a sample project with ideas on how to use the material. You can open it by going to the DLC folder and finding the Sample Project folder inside the Steampunk Town Tiles folder. You can also create your own project and import the tiles you want to use.
 
To create a map using Steampunk Town Tiles, you need to select a tileset from the Tilesets tab in the Database. You can choose from four different tilesets: A1 (animated water and lava), A2 (ground and walls), A3 (buildings and roofs), and A4 (interior objects). You can also mix and match tiles from different tilesets by using the Tileset Editor.
 
Once you have selected a tileset, you can start drawing your map using the Map Editor. You can use different layers to create depth and detail, such as placing roofs over buildings or objects over floors. You can also use events to add interactivity and animation to your map, such as doors, torches, switches, etc.
 
Steampunk Town Tiles also comes with a bonus character (Verne) with a walking sprite and a side-view battler. You can use him as a protagonist or an NPC in your game. To add him to your map, you need to create an event and select his graphic from the Character tab in the Event Editor. You can also assign him a class, skills, equipment, etc. from the Actors tab in the Database.
 
## Tips and Tricks for Using Steampunk Town Tiles
 
Here are some tips and tricks for using Steampunk Town Tiles effectively:
 
- Use contrasting colors and lighting effects to create a steampunk atmosphere. For example, you can use dark brown tones for wood and metal, bright yellow tones for fire and steam, and blue tones for water and sky.
- Use parallax mapping to add more detail and realism to your maps. Parallax mapping is a technique that involves using an image as a background layer for your map instead of tiles. This way, you can create more complex shapes and textures that are not possible with tiles alone. You can use any image editing software to create your own parallax maps or use existing ones from online resources.
- Use plugins to enhance your game's features and functionality. Plugins are scripts that add new functions or modify existing ones in RPG Maker MV. You can find many plugins online that are compatible with Steampunk Town Tiles or other steampunk-related themes. For example, you can use plugins that add steam effects, clockwork mechanisms, airships, etc.
