# Krittibas Ojha Ramayan: A Bengali Epic Poem
 
Krittibas Ojha Ramayan is a Bengali adaptation of the ancient Indian epic Ramayana, written by the poet Krittibas Ojha in the 15th century. It is considered to be one of the most influential works of Bengali literature and culture, as it popularized the story of Rama and Sita among the masses and inspired many later writers and artists.
 
The Krittibas Ojha Ramayan consists of seven parts or kandas, namely Balakanda, Ayodhyakanda, Aranyakanda, Kishkindhakanda, Sundarakanda, Lankakanda and Uttarakanda. The poem follows the original Ramayana closely, but also adds some regional variations and innovations. For example, Krittibas Ojha introduces the concept of Durga Puja, a major Hindu festival in Bengal, as a way of worshipping Sita as an incarnation of the goddess Durga. He also depicts Ravana, the demon king who abducts Sita, as a powerful and learned ruler who respects Rama as his equal.
