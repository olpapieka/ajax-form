## What are the features of Chaos Group Phoenix FD v3.13.00 Plugin for Maya 2015 to 2018 Win?
 
Some of the features of Chaos Group Phoenix FD v3.13.00 Plugin for Maya 2015 to 2018 Win are:
 
- Adaptive grid: The plugin automatically adapts the grid resolution based on the motion of the fluid, which saves memory and improves performance.
- Turbulence: The plugin adds realistic turbulence and vorticity to the fluid motion, which enhances the detail and realism of the simulation.
- Forces: The plugin allows you to apply various forces to the fluid such as gravity, wind, drag, vortex, attraction, etc., which affect its behavior and interaction with other objects.
- Collision: The plugin detects collision between the fluid and other objects such as geometry, particles, fields, etc., which enables you to create complex scenarios such as water hitting rocks or fire spreading on walls.
- Texture: The plugin allows you to apply texture maps to the fluid surface or volume, which adds color, opacity, displacement, emission, etc., to the fluid appearance.
- Motion blur: The plugin supports motion blur for both preview and rendering, which adds realism and smoothness to the fluid motion.
- Caching: The plugin allows you to cache the simulation data on disk or in memory, which speeds up the playback and rendering process.
