One of the methods that some people use is Shutterstock Premium Downloader v2, a software that claims to be able to download any Shutterstock image for free. But is this software really safe and reliable? And how does it work? In this article, we will answer these questions and more.
 
## What is Shutterstock Premium Downloader v2?
 
Shutterstock Premium Downloader v2 is a software that supposedly allows you to download any Shutterstock image for free, without watermark or quality loss. The software claims to use a special algorithm to bypass the Shutterstock security system and generate a direct download link for any image you want.
 
The software also claims to be compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and to support multiple languages. It also promises to be fast and easy to use, with no registration or installation required.
 
## How to Use Shutterstock Premium Downloader v2?
 
To use Shutterstock Premium Downloader v2, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the official website of the software: [https://shutterstock-premium-downloader-v2.com](https://shutterstock-premium-downloader-v2.com)
2. Enter the URL of the Shutterstock image you want to download in the input box and click on "Download".
3. Wait for a few seconds while the software processes your request and generates a download link.
4. Click on the download link and save the image to your device.

## Is Shutterstock Premium Downloader v2 Safe and Legal?
 
The short answer is no. Shutterstock Premium Downloader v2 is neither safe nor legal. Here are some of the reasons why:

- The software is likely to contain malware or viruses that can harm your device or steal your personal information.
- The software is violating the terms and conditions of Shutterstock, which prohibit the unauthorized use or distribution of their images.
- The software is infringing the copyrights of the photographers and artists who created the images on Shutterstock.
- The software is unethical and unfair to the creators who deserve to be compensated for their work.

Therefore, we strongly advise you not to use Shutterstock Premium Downloader v2 or any similar software that claims to offer free downloads of Shutterstock images. Not only are you risking your device's security and your legal liability, but you are also disrespecting the hard work and creativity of the image creators.
 
## What are Some Alternatives to Shutterstock Premium Downloader v2?
 
If you want to download Shutterstock images for free, there are some legitimate and safe alternatives that you can try. Here are some of them:

- Use the free trial option on Shutterstock. You can sign up for a 10-day free trial that gives you access to 10 images per day. You can cancel anytime before the trial ends and keep the images you downloaded.
- Use a free stock photo website. There are many websites that offer free stock photos that you can use for personal or commercial purposes. Some examples are Unsplash, Pixabay, Pexels, and StockSnap.
- Use a paid stock photo website. If you need more variety and quality than what free stock photo websites can offer, you can opt for a paid stock photo website that offers affordable plans and licenses. Some examples are Depositphotos, iStock, Adobe Stock, and Dreamstime.

## Conclusion
 
Shutterstock Premium Downloader v2 is a software that claims to be able to download any Shutterstock image for free. However, this software is not safe or legal, and it can cause serious problems for your device and yourself. Therefore, we recommend you not to use it or any similar software.
