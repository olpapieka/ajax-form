Here are some tips to help you write a short film script in 15 pages:
 
- **Choose a simple and clear premise.** A premise is the basic idea or concept of your story. It should be something that can be summarized in one or two sentences, and that can hook the audience's interest. For example, a premise for a short film script could be: "A lonely man finds a mysterious suitcase that grants him three wishes." or "A young woman tries to escape from a haunted house with her friends."
- **Develop your main character.** Your main character is the protagonist of your story, the one who drives the action and faces the conflict. You should give your main character a clear goal, motivation and flaw. A goal is what your character wants to achieve or avoid. A motivation is why your character wants to achieve or avoid their goal. A flaw is a weakness or problem that prevents your character from achieving their goal easily. For example, a main character for a short film script could be: "A shy and insecure man who wants to find love (goal), but is afraid of rejection (flaw), so he uses the suitcase to make himself more attractive and confident (motivation)."
- **Create an antagonist or obstacle.** An antagonist or obstacle is the force that opposes your main character and creates conflict in your story. It can be a person, a thing, a situation or an internal struggle. You should make your antagonist or obstacle strong enough to challenge your main character and create suspense and tension. For example, an antagonist or obstacle for a short film script could be: "A greedy and ruthless gangster who wants to steal the suitcase from the man." or "A demonic entity that haunts the house and tries to kill the woman and her friends."
- **Structure your story.**A story structure is the way you organize the events and scenes of your story. A common structure for a short film script is the three-act structure, which consists of:
    - The first act: This is where you introduce your main character, their goal, their motivation, their flaw and their normal world. You also introduce your antagonist or obstacle and the inciting incident, which is the event that sets the story in motion and pushes your main character out of their comfort zone.
    - The second act: This is where you develop your main character's journey towards their goal, as they face various challenges, complications and conflicts. You also show how your main character changes or learns something as a result of their experiences. You also build up to the climax, which is the most intense and decisive moment of your story.
    - The third act: This is where you resolve your main character's goal, as they either achieve it or fail to achieve it. You also show the consequences of their actions and how they have changed or grown as a person. You also wrap up any loose ends and provide a satisfying ending for your audience.
- **Write visually and concisely.** A short film script is not only a blueprint for your story, but also a guide for the filmmakers who will bring it to life on screen. Therefore, you should write visually and concisely, using clear and simple language that describes what the audience will see and hear. You should also avoid unnecessary details, descriptions or dialogues that do not advance your story or reveal something about your characters. You should also use proper formatting and conventions for writing a short film script, such as using Courier font, 12-point size, 1-inch margins, sluglines, action lines and dialogue lines.

Writing a short film script in 15 pages can be a fun and rewarding challenge that can help you improve your writing skills and showcase your talent. By following these tips, you can write a short film script that is engaging, original and effective.
