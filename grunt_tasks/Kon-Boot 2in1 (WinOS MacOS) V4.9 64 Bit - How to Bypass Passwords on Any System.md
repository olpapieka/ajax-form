Kon-Boot 2in1 is a software that works by modifying the kernel of the operating system while booting, allowing you to log in as any user without entering the correct password. You can also create a new administrator account or change the existing password with Kon-Boot 2in1. The program supports Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and Mac OS X 10.7-10.14.
  
To use Kon-Boot 2in1, you need to purchase it from the official website[^1^] and download the ISO file. Then, you need to burn the ISO file to a CD or a USB drive using a tool like Rufus[^2^]. After that, you need to boot your locked computer from the CD or USB drive by changing the boot order in the BIOS settings. Once you see the Kon-Boot logo on the screen, you can remove the CD or USB drive and press Enter to continue.
  
Depending on the operating system you want to bypass, you will see different options on the screen. For Windows, you can choose to log in as any user without a password, create a new administrator account or change the existing password. For Mac OS X, you can choose to log in as root without a password or create a new administrator account. After you make your choice, Kon-Boot will do its magic and let you access your computer.
  
Kon-Boot 2in1 is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that can save you time and money when you forget your password for your Windows or Mac computer. However, you should use it responsibly and ethically, as it can also be used for malicious purposes. You should also backup your data regularly and use strong passwords to protect your privacy and security.
  
In this article, we will show you how to use Kon-Boot 2in1 to bypass Windows and Mac passwords step by step. We will use a Windows 10 computer and a Mac OS X 10.14 computer as examples, but the process is similar for other versions of the operating systems.
