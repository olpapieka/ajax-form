The Luger P08 pistol, also known as the Pistole Parabellum, was a semi-automatic handgun that was widely used by Germany and other countries in both World War I and World War II. The Luger P08 was designed by Hugo Borchardt and Georg Luger, and was first produced in 1900 by Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM). The Luger P08 is a distinctive and iconic firearm that is highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. However, identifying and dating a Luger P08 can be challenging, as there are many variations and markings that indicate the origin, model, and year of production of the pistol. In this article, we will explain how to read the serial numbers and other codes on a Luger P08 pistol, and how to use them to determine its history and value.
  
## Serial Numbers
 
The serial number is the most important piece of information for identifying and dating a Luger P08 pistol. The serial number is usually a four-digit number (sometimes with a letter suffix) that is stamped on various parts of the pistol, such as the barrel, the frame, the receiver, the slide, and the magazine. The serial number can give you a good indication of when the pistol was made. For example, serial numbers that start with "A" were most likely made in 1900, while those that start with "B" were made in 1901[^3^]. The serial number can also help you identify the manufacturer and model of the pistol. For instance, serial numbers that start with "42" indicate that the pistol was made by Mauser in 1939 or 1940[^1^].

## Make/Code on Toggle
 
The toggle is the part of the pistol that moves back and forth when firing. On the top of the toggle, there is usually a code or a logo that indicates the maker of the pistol. For example, DWM stands for Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken, which was the original manufacturer of the Luger P08. Other common codes or logos are:

## Chamber Year Date/Code
 
The chamber is the part of the barrel where the cartridge is inserted. On some models of the Luger P08, there is a date or a code stamped on the top of the chamber that indicates when the pistol was made or accepted by the military. For example, a date of 1916 means that the pistol was made or accepted in that year. A code of G means that the pistol was made or accepted in 1935[^1^]. However, not all models have a chamber date or code, so this is not a reliable way to date a Luger P08.
  
## Calibre
 
The calibre is the diameter of the bullet that the pistol fires. The most common calibres for the Luger P08 are 9mm Parabellum and 7.65mm Parabellum. The calibre is usually marked on the left side of the barrel near the muzzle. Sometimes, there is also a letter or a symbol that indicates the country or organization that used or issued the pistol. For example, an N means that the pistol was proofed by Nazi Germany[^1^]. A Crossed Swords means that the pistol was used by Poland[^1^]. A Crossed Keys means that the pistol was used by Finland[^1^]. A Crown over U means that the pistol was proofed by Imperial Germany[^1^]. A Star over B means that the pistol was proofed by Belgium[^1^].
